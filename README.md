# TensorFlow 2 for Deep Learning

## Description

This repository contains source code for the [web notes](https://hanzholahs.github.io/tensorflow-for-deep-learning) on using `TensorFlow 2` (TF2) for building deep learning models. The materials presented in the notes are intended to prepare one before taking the [Google TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate). Nevertheless, some include concepts that are not examined in the certification, including some core techniques behind tensorflow such as `tf.GradientTape` API.

### Other resources

The [web notes](https://hanzholahs.github.io/tensorflow-for-deep-learning) is designed for anyone to practice and revise concept and techniques related to the use of TF2 and Deep Learning problems. There are other resources we personally when first learning TF2, namely:

* Training/bootcamp provided by the Ministry of communication and information under the program [Digital Talent Scholarship](https://digitalent.kominfo.go.id/). 
* The [TensorFlow specialization on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) by DeepLearning.AI, which is also recommended by Google at the certification website.
* The second edition of [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff) book by Fran√ßois Chollet.

## Main Contents

All materials can be classified into three categories, which are basic usage of TF 2, common deep learning tasks, and techniques to preprocess different types of data.

* Basic usage of TF 2: contains brief demo regarding how to use TF 2 for asimple classication and regression tasks based on dummy data. This introduces several high-level layers provided by the `keras` library.
* Regular problems for machine learning: tackles sample problems commonly found in deep learning domains, i.e., `mnist`, `imdb`, `reuters`, and `boston_housing` datasets.
* Preprocessing of data: provides examples on how to deal with specific tasks related to image, text, and time seires data.
