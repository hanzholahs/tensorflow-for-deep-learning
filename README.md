# TensorFlow 2 for Deep Learning

## Description

This repository contains notebooks I use to practice relevant concepts and techniques required for taking the [Google TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate). Nevertheless, anyone could benefit from this repository to learn necessary knowledge and skills before taking their own certificate. For convenience, I recommend anyone with that intention to open all notebooks here via [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) as it is easier to use and setup for implementing Deep Learning model using TensorFlow.

There are several resources I used personally when preparing for the certification. To be specific, these resources include:

* A training provided by the Ministry of communication and information under the program [Digital Talent Scholarship](https://digitalent.kominfo.go.id/). 
* The [TensorFlow specialization on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) by DeepLearning.AI, which is also recommended by Google at the certification website.
* The second edition of [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff) book by Fran√ßois Chollet.

## Outlines

All works here can be classified into three categories, which are basic usage of TF 2, common deep learning tasks, and techniques to preprocess different types of data.

* Basic usage of TF 2: contains brief demo regarding how to use TF 2 for classication and regression tasks based on dummy data. This also introduces several high-level layers provided by the `keras` library.
* Regular problems for machine learning: tackles sample problems commonly found in deep learning domains, i.e., `mnist`, `imdb`, `reuters`, and `boston_housing` datasets.
* Preprocessing of data: provides examples on how to deal with specific tasks related to image, text, and time seires data.
